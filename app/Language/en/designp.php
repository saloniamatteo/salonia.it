		"desc"		=> "Nowadays, to create a good website, you must have solid principles that must be respected: every single decision can impact positively or negatively the user experience. In this page I list the various fundamental elements to consider, so that you may stand out from the competition",
	],
	"mobile"		=> [
		"desc"		=> "One of the main factors to consider is the compatibility with <strong>mobile devices</strong> (phones, tablets): nowadays most people browse the web with their phone, rather than using a computer. For this reason, it's <strong>fundamental</strong> to design a user interface that primarily targets devices with small screens, without obviously forgetting about computers. Often I see websites that, despite having a user interface made for mobile devices, have elements that '<strong>overflow</strong>' from the screen dimentions, making <strong>horizontal scrolling</strong> necessary, or <strong>interactive elements</strong> (like some menus) that don't work, making me visit the website in '<strong>desktop mode</strong>'. Together with this philosophy is <strong>Responsive Design</strong>, that is the <strong>automatic sizing</strong> of the elements, in order to obtain the <strong>best possible view</strong> for <strong>any size</strong> requested.",
	],
	"simple"		=> [
		"desc"		=> "Another important factor to consider is the <strong>simplicity</strong> of navigating a website. If I open a website, I don't expect to find a <strong>labyrinth</strong> to get a simple resource: it must then be <strong>easy to get</strong>, in a <strong>fast way</strong>. Example: if I open Wikipedia, I can search directly what I need. Imagine having to skim through Wikipedia's whole catalog, before finding what you need? You must then design <strong>easy to navigate</strong> user interfaces, following <strong>familiar structures</strong>.",
	],
	"light"			=> [
		"desc"		=> "The <strong>resource lightweightness</strong> is another important factor. In 2024 we're used to ultra-fast <strong>fiber optic</strong> connections, capable of reaching >1Gbps. However, not many places have fast connections, especially in <strong>rural areas</strong>. Lowering the <strong>resource size</strong> is a <strong>benefit for everybody</strong>, both for who's 'serving' the resources, and for the end-user: we lower the <strong>load times</strong>, the <strong>bandwidth</strong> used, and the <strong>computational complexity</strong>, requiring <strong>fewer resources</strong>, <strong>increasing performance</strong>. Sadly, not everyone cares about how many resources are actually requested from a website, preferring the <strong>simplicity of programming</strong>, at the cost of the <strong>end-user experience</strong>. Also, implementing a <strong>CDN</strong> (Content Delivery Network) helps with lowering <strong>resource load times</strong>, especially if they're <strong>closer</strong> to the end-user.",
	],
	"order"			=> [
		"desc"		=> "No less important are the <strong>order</strong> and the <strong>consistency</strong> of a website. Placing <strong>random elements</strong> definitely isn't a good strategy to obtain a <strong>good workflow</strong>, linking back to <strong>simplicity</strong>. Having a <strong>well-ordered website</strong> helps both the <strong>website designers</strong>, and the <strong>end-users</strong>, by being able to browse it without any major complication. Remember to also provide the users with an <strong>easy navigation</strong>: look at the top-right corner, you'll find a <strong>menu</strong> to navigate this website, without having to go back to the index. It's important to also think about how to <strong>structure the text</strong>: pay attention, the text you're reading right now is divided in different <strong>sections</strong>, with <strong>headings</strong> and <strong>paragraphs</strong>, to make it more <strong>legible</strong>; the <strong>keywords</strong> are <strong>bold</strong>. Also, the <strong>headings</strong> are <strong>links</strong> that can be <strong>shared</strong>, to <strong>find</strong> a piece of information more easily.",
	],
	"colors"		=> [
		"desc"		=> "Choosing <strong>colors</strong> with a <strong>good contrast</strong> helps a lot to increase <strong>legibility</strong> and the <strong>recognition</strong> of a website. For example, I chose <strong>blue</strong> as a primary color, and <strong>white</strong> as a secondary color. Often, there are websites that implement a <strong>third color</strong>, depending on designer needs and/or preferences.",
	],
	"languages"		=> [
		"desc"		=> "Last but not least, supporting <strong>multple languages</strong> helps your website to be understood by <strong>many more visitors</strong>, without them having to use a <strong>translator</strong>. Obviously, this depends on your <strong>desired targets</strong>: a website that promotes a <strong>big business</strong> will have much more interest to translate its contents, compared to a business that operates in a  <strong>small territory</strong> and/or a <strong>niche sector</strong>. It's important to also implement a <strong>language selector</strong>, to make sure your <strong>translations</strong> effectively reach the end-user: on my website, the language is <strong>chosen automatically</strong> (between <strong>italian</strong> and <strong>english</strong>, which is the <strong>default language</strong>), based on the <strong>user's browser</strong>. In any case, the user can always <strong>manually choose</strong> the language, keeping the <strong>preference</strong> in every website page.",
